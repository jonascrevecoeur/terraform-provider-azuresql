# azuresql_sqlserver (Data Source)

Defines a connection to the sqlserver. Creating this data source does not yet open/test the connection. Opening the connection happens when reading/provisioning other `azuresql` resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "azuresql_sqlserver" "server" {
  name   = "mysqlserver"
  port   = 1433
}
```

## Schema

### Argument reference
The following arguments are supported:

- `name` (Required, String) Name of the SQL server. This is the value in the url preceeding `.sqlserver.windows.net`.

- `port` (Optional, Number) Port through which to connect to the SQL sqlserver (default 1433).

### Attributes Reference
In addition to the arguments listed above, the following read only attributes are exported:

- `id` (String) ID of the sqlserver connection in `azuresql`. This ID is passed to other `azuresql` resources and data sources to indicate that the resource should be created in/read from this server, respectively.

## ID structure

The ID is formed as `sqlserver::<name>:<port>`, where
* `<name>` is the name of the server.
* `<port>` is the port of the server. Default 1433.
